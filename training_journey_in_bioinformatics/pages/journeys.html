                Following, a preliminary representation of the data collected <b>simplified in complexity</b>
                (assuming that each step of the tree has only one parent, even if this is not the case because one skill
                could be linked to multiple personas or multiple advanced skills). The persona, on the left, represents
                the training aim. In the middle layers, the skills represent the path to it, with more advanced skills
                on the left and more basic on the right. On the rightmost side, the courses are listed.
