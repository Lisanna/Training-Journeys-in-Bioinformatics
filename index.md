# Mapping the training journey in Bioinformatics

This website is the preliminary result of a project started during the 
[de.NBI BioHackathon](https://www.denbi.de/de-nbi-events/1454-biohackathon-germany), happened on 12-16 Dec 2022.

In this project, we aim at mapping the training journey of different personas in Bioinformatics,
visualising the steps needed to acquire expert knowledge in each topic, or skill.
The focus of the project is to link the steps with available training materials/events, with comments
on their quality, accessibility and potential integration. This allows (i) mapping the
relationship/dependencies between open training content and (ii) identifying areas where training
materials should be developed/enhanced by the community.

The organisers are trainers, training coordinators, research support staff and project managers in the
field of bioinformatics and computational biology. We welcome any training enthusiast willing to work
on classifying the available (open) training offer. We also encourage people to join to develop the
technical platform through which this data will be hosted/visualised and future contributions will be
collected.

You will find additional information about our plan in
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dr1tMZiHpzCxKkbb13cNGHga08FcUWmK_lBHDLjAGEM/edit?usp=sharing)
and the data we collected in 
[this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ul2G8EpmDXYiWTx7KRnPYxN77rPHDHJgFLwngX0qMIk/edit?usp=sharing).

We defined 20 example, or use cases, of <b>personas</b> that have a specific background and need
training in bioinformatics to achieve a certain objective. The persona specify the final aim, acquired in
steps correspondind to <b>skills</b>. Each skill can be associated to one or multiple
<b>training materials</b>. The training materials that we linked to in this exercise are <b>openly
available</b> and <b>easy to adopt</b> for learners (include extensive text, questions and self-assessment).
When available, we also linked to the repository where they are stored in editable format to facilitate the
adoption by trainers.
