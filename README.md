# Training-Journeys-in-Bioinformatics

This document describes the "Mapping the training journey in Bioinformatics" project for the [1st de.NBI /
ELIXIR Germany BioHackathon](https://github.com/deNBI/biohackathon-2022).

## Abstract

We aim at mapping the “training journey” of different personas in Bioinformatics, visualising the steps needed to acquire expert knowledge in each topic, or skill. The focus of the project will be to link the steps with available training materials/events, with comments on their quality, accessibility and potential integration. This will allow (i) mapping the relationship/dependencies between open training content and (ii) identifying areas where training materials should be developed/enhanced by the community.

## Topics

* Training
* FAIR
* Open source

## Expected audience

* We welcome any training enthusiast willing to work on classifying the available (open) training offer.
* We also encourage people to join to develop the technical platform through which this data will be hosted/visualised and future contributions will be collected.
