            <h1>Mapping the training journey in Bioinformatics</h1>
            <p>
                This website is the preliminary result of a project started during the <a href="https://www.denbi.de/de-nbi-events/1454-biohackathon-germany">de.NBI BioHackathon</a>, happened on 12-16 Dec 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, we aim at mapping the training journey of different personas in Bioinformatics,
                visualising the steps needed to acquire expert knowledge in each topic, or skill.
                The focus of the project is to link the steps with available training materials/events, with comments
                on their quality, accessibility and potential integration. This allows (i) mapping the
                relationship/dependencies between open training content and (ii) identifying areas where training
                materials should be developed/enhanced by the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                The organisers are trainers, training coordinators, research support staff and project managers in the
                field of bioinformatics and computational biology. We welcome any training enthusiast willing to work
                on classifying the available (open) training offer. We also encourage people to join to develop the
                technical platform through which this data will be hosted/visualised and future contributions will be
                collected.
            </p>

                You will find additional information about our plan in
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dr1tMZiHpzCxKkbb13cNGHga08FcUWmK_lBHDLjAGEM/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a>
                and the data we collected in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ul2G8EpmDXYiWTx7KRnPYxN77rPHDHJgFLwngX0qMIk/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a>.

                We defined 20 example, or use cases, of <b>personas</b> that have a specific background and need
                training in bioinformatics to achieve a certain objective. The persona specify the final aim, acquired in
                steps correspondind to <b>skills</b>. Each skill can be associated to one or multiple
                <b>training materials</b>. The training materials that we linked to in this exercise are <b>openly
                available</b> and <b>easy to adopt</b> for learners (include extensive text, questions and self-assessment).
                When available, we also linked to the repository where they are stored in editable format to facilitate the
                adoption by trainers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following, a preliminary representation of the data collected <b>simplified in complexity</b>
                (assuming that each step of the tree has only one parent, even if this is not the case because one skill
                could be linked to multiple personas or multiple advanced skills). The persona, on the left, represents
                the training aim. In the middle layers, the skills represent the path to it, with more advanced skills
                on the left and more basic on the right. On the rightmost side, the courses are listed.
